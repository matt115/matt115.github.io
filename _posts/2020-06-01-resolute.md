## **Information Gathering**

We start with nmap doing some enumeration to know the open ports:

![nmap]({% link assets/htb/resolute/nmap.png %})

It's a window's box, so we try to enumerate further with enum4linux:

![enum4linux]({% link assets/htb/resolute/enum4linux.png %}) 

From there, we found a bunch of usernames through SIDs:

![usernames]({% link assets/htb/resolute/usernames.png %})

Grepping through the results for comments we can find a password for user Marko:

![marko_pwd]({% link assets/htb/resolute/enum4linux_creds.png %})

## Getting the access

Now that we have some valid creds we try to access to the smb shares.. 

![smb_access_denied]({% link assets/htb/resolute/enum4linux_access.png %})

.. no luck!

So maybe we can try the same password on the other accounts, hoping on the admin laziness..

![cme_access]({% link assets/htb/resolute/cme_smb.png %})

.. and BINGO! We have now a valid account, Melanie's one.

Now we try to list shares:
![cme_melanie]({% link assets/htb/resolute/cme_smb_melanie.png %})

Searching on sysvol for gpp passwords returned nothing.. 

So we try to log on the WinRM service on the standard port and we obtain a shell :)

![melanie_access]({% link assets/htb/resolute/melanie_access.png %})

We can now read the user flag:

![user_flag]({% link assets/htb/resolute/user_flag.png %})

Now it's time for privilege escalation !

## **Privilege Escalation**

We check groups and accounts info:

![whoami_low]({% link assets/htb/resolute/whoami_low.png %})

Nothing special with this user.. poking around nothing was found.

After a few researches, i noticed that powershell 5 is enabled.. and an interesting feature 
comes with WMF5, that enhances the security; Powershell Transcription.

So I checked if the feature was enabled querying the HKLM registry:

![pwsh_trans]({% link assets/htb/resolute/pwsh_trans.png %})

We can see that a transcript file is enabled and is stored in C:\PSTranscript location as an hidden file

Looking at the transcript I found Ryan account's creds

![ryan_creds]({% link assets/htb/resolute/ryan_creds.png %})

At this point I noticed something very interesting.. ryan user is member of DnsAdmins in the domain.
Googlin' around, I found a [techinique][technique_link] for privilege escalation that consists in reconfigure with a
malicious dll the dns service. This dll can be loaded remotely so to not get be spotted by Defender.

Let's begin.

### **The Exploit**

So we upload accesschck.exe on the victim box

![upload]({% link assets/htb/resolute/access_upload.png %})

We check now what kind of rights we have on the DNS service typing accesschk -accepteula -ucqv dns

![dns_priv]({% link assets/htb/resolute/srv_privs.png %})

Now we check the architecture of the system to build the right dll 

![arch]({% link assets/htb/resolute/proc_arch.png %})

We create our malicious dll 

![dll]({% link assets/htb/resolute/dll.png %})

We set the smbserver online through impacket smbserver.py to serve our dll through the network

![smb_server]({% link assets/htb/resolute/smb_server.png %})

and set an handler for the incoming back connection with nc -lnvp 443 

### **Getting the System**

Then we change configuration for the DNS service to load the dll served by our smb online share and restart the service 

![exploit]({% link assets/htb/resolute/exploit.png %})

Now if we check our smb share we can see that the victim machine requested the payload correctly

![exploit_conn]({% link assets/htb/resolute/exploit_conn.png %})

and checking the handler we have a privileged shell back!

![root]({% link assets/htb/resolute/root.png %})

.. pwned! (:
